# WomenInPythonShenzhen
#### Welcome to the Women in Python Shenzhen! 

The Women Meetup for Python group initiated this project together
with Trouble Maker Shenzhen (https://troublemaker.site/) aiming at encouraging women to code.

Here you find the material used in our weekly meetings. If you are in Shenzhen, feel free to drob by and have some fun learning Python.
