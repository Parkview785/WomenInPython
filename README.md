### New here?

Please make sure to have Python3 installed in your computer prior to the class.

We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section. 

We use Jupyter Notebook web-application to run most of our Python codes. To start your Jupyter Notebook:

[1] Open a terminal window (see instructions for Windows: https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/; Linux: https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu; and IOS: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/256259/how-to-open-terminal-in-mac-using-keyboard-shortcut).

[2] Go to the directory where you have your Notebooks.

[3] Type: jupyter notebook (and hit enter key).

You should now be able to run the Notebooks available in this repository (ipynb file extension).
