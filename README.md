# WomenInPythonShenzhen
#### Welcome to the Women in Python Shenzhen! 

The Women Meetup for Python group initiated this project together
with Trouble Maker Shenzhen (https://troublemaker.site/) aiming at encouraging women to code.

Here you find the material used in our weekly meetings. If you are in Shenzhen, feel free to drob by and have some fun learning Python.

### New here?

Please make sure to have Python3 installed in your computer prior to the class.

We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section. 

We use Jupyter Notebook web-application to run most of our Python codes. To start your Jupyter Notebook:

[1] open a terminal window (see instructions for Windows: https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/; Linux: https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu; and IOS: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/256259/how-to-open-terminal-in-mac-using-keyboard-shortcut).

[2] Go to the directory where you have your Notebooks.

[3] type: jupyter notebook (and hit enter key).

You should now be able to run the Notebooks available in this repository (ipynb file extension).
